# Getting Started on the Server

To run these codes in interactive mode, you must have the following modules loaded:
    stata/17
    anaconda/2021.11
    julia/1.8.0

To load them, you may run ``module load MODULE_NAME`` for each module from the
command prompt, or you may type ``source .configmake/loadmodules.sh`` which
will automatically load in all necessary modules.

Running these codes in batch mode will automatically load in these modules--there is no need 
to do anything in this case.

# TODO
Make python files for database update... A lot of the same code copied. Should be fixed.



To run this project, run ``make all``.

Consult the Makefile for details. Run ``make help`` for some information on what commands do what.
